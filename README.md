# Otto hands and LED Matrix

Here are libraries and sketches for Otto DIY robot, with all files neccesary for LED Matrix and some features under developmnet

Otto has:

- bluetooth
- rechargable lipo battery
- touch sensor
- RGB led nose
- LED matrix for mouths
- internal voltage measurment

v2 sketch is for version with 2 buttons for mode change (first button dance, second button walk+avoid, both together = react to noise)
v3 sketch has only 1 button or touch sensor and changes modes on touch (dance -> walk -> react to noise -> standby -> dance....)
Everything else is the same.
