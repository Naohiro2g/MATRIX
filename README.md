+Touch sensor use this [2PCS TTP223 Capacitive Touch Switch Button Self-Lock Module for Arduino](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2PCS-TTP223-Capacitive-Touch-Switch-Button-Self-Lock-Module-for-Arduino/131662428748?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)

Here are libraries and sketches for Otto DIY robot, with all files neccesary for LED Matrix and some features under developmnet

- Bluetooth
- rechargable lipo battery
- touch sensors
- RGB led nose
- LED matrix for mouths
- internal voltage measurment

v2 sketch is for version with 2 buttons for mode change (first button dance, second button walk+avoid, both together = react to noise)
v3 sketch has only 1 button or touch sensor and changes modes on touch (dance -> walk -> react to noise -> standby -> dance....)
Everything else is the same.
